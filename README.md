# About The Project

This is a To-do App, where features include being able to create to-do tasks with titles, descriptions, and dates (however you interpret dates).
You are able to organize these tasks by projects, and the app automatically does so. When changing colors from dark to light or vice versa, the text and border colors
adapt accordingly. You are not able to drag around projects and tasks.

Please note that there is no user login system and the data for tasks and projects are stored in one MongoDB database, so changes to tasks/projects made by anybody will be seen by any users who view the site.
